          My name is Swabri Musa, an aspiring Golang developer based in Kisumu, Kenya. I began my tech journey with a foundation in Electrical Engineering, having graduated with a Higher National Diploma in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from DeKUT. My switch to software development came in 2024 after completing my attachment at KPLC, and Iâ€™m now immersed in coding at Zone01 Kisumu, learning Go and sharpening my problem-solving skills.

          <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          With a passion for understanding the fundamentals, I thrive in peer-to-peer environments, tackling diverse projects from file systems to ASCII art. I recently joined the Kisumu Gophers community at LakeHub and attended GopherCon Africa, which further ignited my enthusiasm for Go.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-200 leading-relaxed">
          Driven by a commitment to bridge tech and the electrical field in sub-Saharan Africa, I aspire to become a versatile developer who inspires and collaborates with others. Connect with me if you share a similar passion for tech and innovation in Africa!

            When I'm not coding, you can find me watching science talks on RI youtube channel.
